## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Normalize ecommerce-image UI copy to UTF-8 Chinese (template, prompts, toasts).
- [x] 1.2 Refactor template option data model to use stable IDs; update selection/edit/add/remove logic and localStorage persistence.
- [x] 1.3 Reflow page layout into workflow sections with clearer hierarchy and empty states (single-page layout retained).
- [x] 1.4 Implement chip editor interactions (multi-select, inline edit, add/delete) aligned with new data model.
- [x] 1.5 Implement structured prompt preview with labeled segments, variable highlighting, and copy action.
- [x] 1.6 Update styles in `frontend/src/styles/ecommerce-image.css` for new layout and components; ensure responsive behavior.
- [ ] 1.7 Validate manually: select product, edit chips, verify preview updates, generate disabled state; optional `npm run build` in `frontend`.
